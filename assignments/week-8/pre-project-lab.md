##Group Projects

####Submit your team's idea to this Trello [board](https://trello.com/b/84evOb3s/project-2). Please, link to your own Trello board that will include your main user-stories and an image of your schema, both pending instructor approval.

##Housekeeping

####1) Update your Github with a profile picture

####2) Send last week's weekend [lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-14/notes/blob/master/lectures/week-7/_5_friday/lab/week-lab.md), the self-learning blog-post / app experiment, to `ilias.tsangaris@ga.co` for the class to reference during their projects
